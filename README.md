# Journey learning go.

### This is to document my journey into learning Golang. Some of the code from this was a part of the video uploaded to Youtube from FreeCodeCamp and some from Udemy. I will be adding more code as I learn more about Go.

## Why Go?

I have been primarily using python for the past year and a half and I wanted to learn a new language. I chose Go because it is a compiled language and I wanted to learn how to use a compiled language. I also wanted to learn how to use a language that is used in the industry and may end up using in the future and perhaps even get a better paying job.

## Install the latest Go.

- You can download the latest version of Go from [here](https://go.dev/dl/) for your operating system.
- You can also use the command `sudo apt install golang-go` to install the latest version of Go on Ubuntu.
- If you are on Windows, I would suggest you use the `.msi` installer to avoid the hassle of setting up the environment variables using the `.zip` file or the `WSL` method.

## Compile the programs.

- use the comamnd `go build {file.go}` to compile the program to and build an executable.

## Run the programs.

- use the command `go run {file.go}` to run the program without compiling it.
- use the command `./{file}` to run the compiled executable.
